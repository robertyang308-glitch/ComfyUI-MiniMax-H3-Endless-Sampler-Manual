# ComfyUI-HR-Endless-Sampler 
## (the older ComfyUI MiniMax H3 Sampler Unlimited)

`HR Endless Sampler` is a chunked replacement for ComfyUI's
`SamplerCustomAdvanced` for long video/audio latents, currently supports 
Minimax H3 only. The plan is to add support to LTX 2.5 in the near future.

`HR Endless Sampler` is able to render videos of any length by automatically 
splitting the inference into small chunks of the same long latent. It uses 
Gemma4 12B QAT internally to analyze the original prompt and all references, 
plan the action-timing for each shot and each chunk, then analyzes previous 
rendered frames and writes new small prompts for each chunk, maintaining 
the continuity and coherence of the entire video. 

Using `HR Endless Sampler Preview` node (based on the amazing KJ Live preview node) 
allows to visualize the whole video as it is infered, with a timeslider that displays
the video shots and each chunk. You can even visualize each chunk prompt Gemma created
by holding the mouse pointer over a chunk bar.

The `HR Endless Sampler Save Video` and `HR Endless Sampler Load Video` also display the timeslider with all the features of the preview node. They also have an extra button "Macthing Videos" that display a list of the last videos with the same filename prefix, so we can quickly compare previous renders with newer ones, also seeing the chunks, prompts, time to render, etc.:

## Quick HELP as I don't have a workflow template yet!
The way to use is pretty straight forward - just replace the normal "Sampler" node by this one, and add the preview node behind it so it can show the preview as the inference happens. You just have to add the extra inputs:
- `clip` - just connect the model clip
- `vae` - just connect the video vae model
- `images` - connect the images you used with minimax guiding - for ref2va, those would be the reference images
- `prompt` - connect the text of the full prompt you are using with minimax
- `fps` - should always be 24, but if you have a node that sets the fps, you can connect it here too.

## Included nodes

The extension installs four nodes:

| Node | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `HR Endless Sampler` | Samples a long latent serially, asks Gemma to plan the complete production and direct each chunk, and outputs the finished latent, chunk prompts, and timeline metadata. |
| `HR Endless Sampler Preview` | Patches the model with the live accumulated preview, ordered chunk playback, shot brackets, prompt/timing tooltips, frame stepping, performance graphs, and browser-refresh recovery. |
| `HR Endless Sampler Save Video` | Saves ordinary video, animated VHS formats, or float EXR sequences while preserving the Endless timeline, prompts, shot/chunk mapping, render timing, and optional audio. |
| `HR Endless Sampler Load Video` | Browses or uploads finished media, restores its interactive timeline immediately in the browser, and outputs decoded video/images, audio, dimensions, FPS, frame count, filename, and timeline to a queued workflow. |

The Save and Load players use the same colored chunk timeline and shot brackets
as the live Preview node, but omit the live sampling graphs. Hovering a chunk
shows its H3 prompt and the sampler/Gemma/miscellaneous timing breakdown.

## Main settings

`chunk_frames` is the number of frames sampled in one H3 call. Use the largest
value that fits in VRAM. Smaller chunks use less VRAM, but need more handoffs.
For example, 39 frames is a practical 1080p starting point on a 16 GB GPU.
H3 uses a `5 + 17k` frame grid, so the effective size is aligned to that grid.

`video_continuation` is the number of completed frames carried from the last
chunk into the next one. H3 sees them as a synchronized `<Video N>` and
`<Audio N>` reference. `22` frames is a good default for continuity. `5` is
the minimum. Larger values use more VRAM. If it is larger than the current
chunk, the sampler caps it to the chunk size.

The sampler also uses the previous chunk's final five frames as a small H3
boundary keyframe. This is automatic. It helps adjacent chunks meet cleanly.

`cache_gemma_preproduction` saves Gemma's static preproduction context in
system RAM. This can make later Gemma requests much faster because they do not
need the full source prompt and shot plan again. Linux uses `/dev/shm` when it
has enough free RAM; otherwise the normal temporary directory is used. The
cache uses several GiB of RAM, never VRAM. It is optional and does not change
the generated video.

`gemma4_mtp` enables Gemma's native four-token draft-MTP decoder. Turn it off
to run the original non-MTP decoder and compare speed on the same workflow.
The console reports generated tokens/second and, in MTP mode, the assistant's
draft-token acceptance rate, proposal count, verification work, rollback
replays, and checkpoint time. This is real speculative decoding: the matching
Gemma assistant proposes as many as four tokens and the 12B target verifies
them together.

`debug` adds detailed prompt and memory information to the console.

`debug_stop_chunk` stops after a selected 1-based chunk. `0` means render the
whole video.

`debug_start_chunk` reruns from a selected 1-based chunk. It is useful for
testing a later shot without sampling all earlier chunks again. The first run
creates a temporary replay cache; later compatible runs reuse its noise,
completed chunks, and continuation boundary. Set it back to `0` to clear that
temporary cache on the next render.

If the main prompt changes during a replay, the sampler keeps the saved physical
frames and noise but asks Gemma to make a new preproduction plan from the new
prompt. It also rebuilds the Gemma KV cache. This lets prompt changes such as
moving dialogue earlier in a shot affect the rerun chunk.

## How the sampler works

The sampler runs chunks in order. A chunk finishes all H3 sampling steps before
the next chunk begins. The completed tail becomes the next chunk's Video1/Audio1
continuation reference.

Before Chunk 1, Gemma reads the complete prompt and plans the timing of every
source shot. It knows every physical chunk boundary before H3 starts. This gives
Gemma a full view of a long action instead of making it guess each chunk in
isolation.

For every chunk, Gemma receives:

- the complete original prompt and the relevant timing plan;
- the frames and shots the chunk must produce;
- the latest generated stills from the previous chunk, sampled at 2 FPS plus
  its exact final frame; and
- the previous chunk's Gemma prompt and end state, when they still match the
  current source prompt.

Gemma writes one short H3 `detailed_description` for that chunk. It keeps exact
dialogue inside `<d>...</d>`, preserves real shot cuts, and uses local H3
timecodes for cuts. H3 receives only that final description, not Gemma's JSON
notes or planning data.

The sampler saves the latest Gemma transcript after every chunk, even with
`debug` off:

```text
${TMPDIR}/comfyui-hr-endless-sampler/last_gemma_chunk_prompts.txt
${TMPDIR}/comfyui-hr-endless-sampler/last_gemma_images/
```

The text file includes the preproduction plan, each request to Gemma, Gemma's
JSON response, any correction request, and the final prompt sent to H3. The
image directory contains the stills that Gemma saw. A new render replaces both.

## Gemma 4 setup

The sampler uses the official Google Gemma 4 12B QAT Q4 GGUF model through
`llama-cpp-python`. When `gemma4_mtp` is enabled, the matching native MTP
assistant proposes up to four tokens at a time. Install the CUDA 12.5
dependencies with ComfyUI's Python:

```bash
~/comfyui/tools/python.sh -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

On first use, the sampler downloads Gemma, its projector, and the matching
465 MB Q8 MTP assistant to:

```text
models/llama_cpp/gemma-4-12b-it-qat-q4_0/
```

Gemma runs in a separate process between H3 chunks. H3, Qwen, and the video VAE
are unloaded before Gemma runs, and the Gemma process exits before H3 sampling
resumes. This is intentional: it releases Gemma's CUDA allocations before H3
needs VRAM again. If native MTP is enabled but the platform wheel lacks its
required symbols, the Gemma pass stops with an explicit error; it never
silently labels ordinary decoding as MTP. Disable `gemma4_mtp` to deliberately
use the original decoder.

The fast MTP checkpoint path is currently experimental in upstream llama.cpp.
Gemma therefore runs inside a disposable worker. If native MTP aborts that
worker, the sampler preserves the exact request and retries **only that failed
Gemma operation once** with the original non-MTP decoder. It does not disable
MTP for the rest of the render, and it does not discard the preproduction KV
cache or any other request data: the next Gemma operation attempts MTP again.
Ordinary prompt/schema errors remain visible and are not mistaken for an MTP
crash. The upstream failure is tracked in
[llama.cpp issue #27439](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/issues/27439).

The editable Gemma instructions are in
[`gemma4_prompts.txt`](gemma4_prompts.txt). The sampler reads this file again
before preproduction and before each chunk. You can adjust the wording without
editing Python, but keep the named section headers and `{{placeholders}}`.

## Preview node

Place `HR Endless Sampler Preview` in the model path before the guider used by
the sampler. Connect the actual H3 model through the preview node, then use its
model output for the guider and sampler.

The preview plays every completed chunk in order. It can restore the current
preview after a browser refresh. Its timeline uses a different color for each
chunk and shows brackets for source shots. Hover a chunk color to see Gemma's
H3 prompt, H3 render time, Gemma processing time, and total processing time for
that chunk. Only the prompt prose is colored: each shot section uses the same
color as its shot bracket, including prompts containing a single shot.

Use the small play/pause button, Space, or the timeline to control playback.
Focus the preview and use Left/Right for frame stepping. The lower-right label
shows the output frame and, when available, the shot and chunk number.

`tiny_vae: none` uses the fast H3 Latent2RGB preview. Select
`taeh3.safetensors` for a more representative preview. Tiny-VAE preview costs
more time and VRAM. `max_resolution: 0` keeps the latent preview resolution.
The preview FPS can be changed while it is playing and does not affect sampling.

## Save and load finished videos

`HR Endless Sampler` now has a fourth `timeline` output. Connect it, together
with decoded `images`, to `HR Endless Sampler Save Video`. The Save node has
its own lighter version of the preview player: it plays the finished render,
keeps the colored chunk bar and shot brackets, shows each chunk's Gemma prompt
and saved timing details on hover, and colors each prompt's shot sections to
match the shot brackets. It supports play/pause, timeline seeking, and
Left/Right frame stepping. The status line also shows the full sampler render
time saved with the video. It intentionally has no sampler graphs.

`video/h264-mp4` uses ComfyUI's native video encoder and does not require Video
Helper Suite. It supports the Save node's CRF, 8/10-bit pixel-format choice,
audio muxing, and embedded timeline metadata. The other ordinary formats call
the installed **Video Combine 🎥🅥🅗🅢** encoder directly. Their `pixel_format`
uses the corresponding VHS options (`auto` keeps the format's VHS default),
and `crf` is passed through whenever that encoder supports CRF. Other VHS
format-specific settings retain their VHS defaults. Connect decoded `audio`
to mux its soundtrack into ordinary video output. When VHS is installed, the
format menu includes every Video Combine choice, including animated GIF and
WebP, plus native H.264 and the Endless-only EXR option.

`video/exr` writes an OpenEXR image sequence. Choose `half` for 16-bit float
or `float` for 32-bit float, plus `none`, `rle`, `zip1`, or `zip16`
compression. `exr_gamma` exposes the encoder's remaining gamma option; leave
it at `1.0` for raw values. EXR saving never clamps the tensor it receives. For the H3 VAE's
actual decoder values—including values below 0 or above 1—connect the sampler
`output` latent and the H3 `vae` to the optional Save-node `latent` and `vae`
inputs. That path bypasses only H3's final display clamp before writing EXR.
The resulting EXR contains those raw VAE RGB values; it does not silently apply
an sRGB-to-linear color conversion. An EXR sequence cannot contain audio, so a
connected `audio` input is written beside it as a 32-bit float WAV sidecar and is
included in the Save/Load node's browser preview.

Native H.264 and VHS formats that support container metadata write the compact
timeline to the `hr_endless_sampler_timeline` tag. Every export also receives an
adjacent sidecar:

```text
your_render.mp4.hr_endless_sampler_timeline.json
```

The sidecar is always written because transcoding services can remove custom
video metadata. EXR uses the same sidecar for the full sequence manifest and
also embeds the timeline in its first EXR frame. `HR Endless Sampler Load
Video` opens a saved video or the first EXR frame/sidecar in the same player;
it prefers the sidecar and falls back to embedded video metadata. Its `fps` is
only a playback-rate override; `0` uses the rate stored with the render.

The Load node includes **Browse output…** and **Upload video…** controls.
Browse output opens a folder dialog rooted at ComfyUI's `output` directory; it
can navigate subfolders, lists supported video files and standalone EXRs, and
shows each saved Endless EXR sequence as one item instead of hundreds of frame
files. Small Name, Size, and Date buttons change the ordering; Date is the
default, with the newest item first. Upload video copies a file from the browser machine into
`output/hr_endless_sampler_uploads/` using 16 MiB chunks, then fills the node's
path automatically. Choosing or uploading immediately probes the media, reads
its timeline metadata, and fills the player without queueing the workflow.
Queue the node when downstream nodes need its timeline, filename, FPS, native
ComfyUI `VIDEO`, decoded `IMAGE` frame batch, `AUDIO`, frame count, width, or
height outputs. The browser-only preview remains lightweight; the full frame
and audio decode happens when the workflow queues the Load node.

Both Save and Load also have a **Matching videos ▾** dropdown, ordered newest
first. On Save it lists `filename_prefix*` from the matching output folder. On
Load it derives the prefix from the current `video` path by removing the
generated `_<number>_…` suffix—for example,
`video/render_00042_.mp4` searches for `video/render*`. Selecting an entry
switches the player immediately; on Load it also replaces the serialized
`video` value.

## Prompt format

Use MiniMax's normal shot format. The first shot has no timecode. Later shots
use a strictly increasing cut time:

```text
[Shot 1] The tiger runs through the jungle.
[Shot 2] At 00:02.833, the camera cuts inside the temple.
```

Set `fps` to the same frame rate used by those timecodes. H3 normally uses
24 FPS. The sampler converts cut times to frames, keeps each real cut at the
correct position inside its physical chunk, and gives H3 the corresponding
local timecode.

For Ref2VA, keep the reference images in the same order as the original H3
conditioning. The sampler keeps those identity/style references for every
chunk. The generated Video1 continuation reference is added separately.

## Memory and performance

The first chunk can fit while the second chunk fails. Later chunks include the
Video1/Audio1 continuation tail, so they use more VRAM than Chunk 1. Choose a
`chunk_frames` and `video_continuation` pair that fits Chunk 2 as well.

Chunking reduces the temporal part of H3's memory use. It cannot make an
arbitrary resolution fit: one full-resolution H3 sampling step must still fit
in VRAM.

The console shows chunk progress, H3 step progress, and Gemma preparation
progress with live generated tokens/second. The end-of-run report includes H3, Qwen, VAE, and Gemma time,
plus peak RAM and VRAM use.

## Current limits

- The released backend currently supports MiniMax H3 only.
- Multi-chunk H3 rendering needs the H3 video VAE.
- Chunked denoise masks are not supported.
- The sampler can reconstruct image and audio Ref2VA inputs. It cannot turn an
  image input back into an original video Ref2VA source.
- Gemma observes generated video frames, not generated audio. It preserves
  dialogue and sound instructions from the source prompt, but does not judge
  the resulting soundtrack.

## TIPS TO RENDER 1080p with 16GB of VRAM:  
 - These tips are from my workflow using ref2va with 5 images at 720p resolution as reference. 
 - To render a 625 frames video at 1080p with only 16GB of VRAM, I use 56 `chunk_frames` and 22 `video_continuation` frames. This configuration may OOM without  `KJNodes MiniMax H3 Low VRAM Attention`. `KJNodes MiniMax H3 Low VRAM Attention` helps reduce VRAM memory peaks which is specially necessary during all chunks after Chunk1, since those chunks have an extra 22 frames to deal with. I set it to `4` and it renders 1080p without problems.
 - If you don't want to use the amazing `KJNodes MiniMax H3 Low VRAM Attention`, you still can render 1080p by reducing `chunk_frames` to 39.
 - off course this all changes depending on how many (and resolution) reference images/videos/audio you are using.
